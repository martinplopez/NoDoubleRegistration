# UniqueEmailRegistrations â€“ Dynamics 365 Plugin

Ensure that a contact can register **only once per event** via Real-Time Marketing / form submissions in Dynamics 365.  
This plugin validates a form submission by checking whether the submitted **email address** already has an **event registration** for the specified **event**.

> âœ… If the email is **not** already registered for the event â†’ the submission is valid.  
> ðŸš« If the email **is** already registered â†’ the plugin flags the `emailaddress1` field as invalid so the form can show an inline error.
